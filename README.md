## Overview

### The challenge

Explore our website seamlessly with the Intro Section featuring Dropdown Navigation! 

This component allows users to:-
- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- Ensuring an optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size. 
- Users can also see hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation_frontend_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project can be of great help if one is looking for a kind of project that can help us revise a large variety of CSS and JS concepts all in one as implementing it successfully means knowing all fundamental concepts of programming well. One such example snippet is as shown below-

```js
const toggleSubNavs = (navLinkTitle, i) => {
  const subNavLink = navLinkTitle.nextElementSibling;
  !navLinkTitle.parentElement.classList.contains("open")
    ? (subNavLink.style.maxHeight = `${subNavLink.scrollHeight + 32}px`)
    : (subNavLink.style.maxHeight = "0px");
  navLinkTitles.forEach((_navLinkTitle, _i) => {
    if (i !== _i) {
      const subNavLink = _navLinkTitle.nextElementSibling;
      _navLinkTitle.parentElement.classList.remove("open");
      if (subNavLink) subNavLink.style.maxHeight = "0px";
    }
  });
  navLinkTitle.parentElement.classList.toggle("open");
};

navLinkTitles.forEach((navLinkTitle, i) => {
  navLinkTitle.addEventListener("click", () => {
    toggleSubNavs(navLinkTitle, i);
  });
});
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in JavaScript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
